# Employee Attrition Analysis
Employee Attrition is a term used to describe the process or rate at which employees leave an organization or company, either voluntarily (such as resignations) or involuntarily (such as layoffs). It is an important indicator for companies to understand their workforce stability, measure employee satisfaction and engagement levels, and identify factors influencing employee turnover.

## 1. The Main Problem
Out of the 4,410 employees, 16.1% or 710 employees underwent attrition. If the 710 employee attrition is multiplied by $4,700 dollars, the cost amounts to $3,3337,000. So, high employee attrition causes high recruitment costs.
